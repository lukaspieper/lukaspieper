Hi there,

welcome to my GitHub profile. My name is Lukas Pieper and I'm a .NET developer, however doing mostly Android related coding in my free time.
Furthermore, open source enthusiast and interested in security and privacy.

Get in touch on Mastodon: [@lukaspieper@social.tchncs.de](https://social.tchncs.de/@lukaspieper)

**Here is a short list of my active projects:**

- [x] Truvark, my modern file encryption app for Android. For now, only partly open source. Read more on it at
[XDA-Developers](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/app-7-0-early-access-truvark-modern-file-encryption.4500311/) or download from 
[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.lukaspieper.truvark).
- [x] [Gcam-Services-Provider](https://github.com/lukaspieper/Gcam-Services-Provider), stub application to get Gcam working without Google 
Play Services.
